   This is the Mark Logic Java Content Repository (JCR, aka JSR-170)
source tree.  There are several sub directories here that contain sub-parts
of of the project.

   If you downloaded and extracted the mljcr-src.zip file, then you don't
have the full source tree, but you have enough to build and run.  There is
also a binary-only zip file (mljcr-bin.zip) which contains the pre-compiled
jar files that you will need.

   If you want the full source tree, you can fetch it with Subversion
(see the http://developer.marklogic.com/code/).  The other stuff there
is not needed to setup a JCR repository with Jack Rabbit.

   TODO: More to come here.
