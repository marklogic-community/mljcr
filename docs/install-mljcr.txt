	Installing MLJCR on MarkLogic Server

   Setting up to run MLJCR involves two steps.  Configuring your JackRabbit
based application to use the MLJCR Java classes and installing the MLJCR
XQuery modules in MarkLogic Server.  See the document run-mljcr.txt for
information about setting up the Java side.  This document covers the
XQuery part.

   MLJCR uses XCC (the Java<->Mark Logic connector) to issue requests
to Mark Logic.  You must setup an XDBC appserver for XCC using the
Mark Logic Admin UI  XCC speaks the XDBC protocol.

   Included in the binary zip file is a directory hierarchy like this:

      Modules/
         MarkLogic/
            jcr/
               filesystem/
               lib/
               state/

   The directories under 'jcr' contain the XQuery modules invoked by the
MLJCR Java classes.  These modules are referenced from Java with paths
that start with /MarkLogic/jcr.  These XQuery modules are also in the
source tree under mljcr/src/xquery.

   There are two ways that you can set things up to run these modules.


1) Server-wide

   MarkLogic Server has a special directory that contains modules
that are in scope for all appservers, regardless of the "root" setting
in the Admin UI.  These modules are located under the "Modules" directory
in the server installation directory (/opt/MarkLogic/Modules on Linux).

   If you want to make the MLJCR functionality available to all appservers,
place the "jcr" directory under /opt/MarkLogic/Modules/MarkLogic.  That's
all there is to it.  No server restart is needed, the modules will be
available immediately.  Doing this makes the XQuery modules appear
as if they are in the module root at the relative path /MarkLogic/jcr/.

   Note that placing modules under the MarkLogic Server installation
directory is not directly supported.  Subsequent server upgrades may
remove the MLJCR modules  Keep a copy around in a different location
and re-install them after an upgrade if needed.

   Server-wide modules are in scope whether or not a specific XDBC
server is configured to run modules from the filesystem or a database.


2) Per Appserver

   If you want to limit MLJCR to a single XDBC appserver, you will need
to place the XQuery modules under the module root for that appserver.  You
must maintain the same structure so that the MLJCR modules are under
MarkLogic/jcr relative to the module root.

   For example, if the appserver's module root is /foo/bar/mymodules,
then the MLJCR modules should be at /foo/bar/mymodules/MarkLogic/jcr/...
You can also place the modules under a directory relative to the Mark Logic
instalation, such as /opt/MarkLogic/Docs (which is configured as just /Docs).
The same applies here, place them at /opt/MarkLogic/Docs/MarkLogic/jcr/...

   If the appserver is set to run modules from a database, then the MLJCR
modules must also be loaded into that database, at similar relative URIs.
