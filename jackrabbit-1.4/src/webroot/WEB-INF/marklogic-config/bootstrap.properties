#bootstrap properties for the repository startup servlet.
#
# **** Note: You need to change the web.xml file (one level up) to
#      set the "bootstrap-config" property to the path of this file
#      in *both* the Repository and RepositoryStartup servlet configs.
#
# **** Note: you also need to change the XCC URL in the repository.xml
#      file in this directory.  It's in there three times, set them all
#      to the same value.
#
# **** This should be set to the absolute path of the repository.xml file
#      that is in the .war file.  You basically need to replace everthing
#      before /repository.xml with the path to this directory.
repository.config=/Users/ron/Work/marklogic/jsr170/jackrabbit-1.4/src/webroot/WEB-INF/marklogic-config/repository.xml
#
# **** This is the path that will be used within Mark Logic.  Due to some
#      brain damage in the standard JackRabbit setup, this must also be
#      a valid and writable path on the local filesystem where some directories
#      will be created (but left empty).  All content and metadata will be
#      stored in Mark Logic.  You can probably leave this as-is.  If you're
#      on Windows, this may or may not work - you're on your own.
repository.home=/tmp/JackRabbitWebappRepo
